* Add more animal catagories and more neccessary information about pets including vaccination, weight and so on;
* Adding a function for users to upload pet information including filling out forms, taking and uploading photos and even videos. Also removing or marking pets that have already been adopted;
* UI optimization like Night and day mode switching.
